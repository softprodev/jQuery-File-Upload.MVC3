# **jQuery-File-Upload.MVC3** #

This is an example of how to integrate a [jQuery-File-Upload plugin](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload) into an ASP.NET MVC 3 application.

It is identical to the [original plugin demo](http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/ "jQuery File Upload Demo") and supports batch **upload**, **download** and **deletion** of uploaded files.
